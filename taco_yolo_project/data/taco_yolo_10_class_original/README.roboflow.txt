The dataset includes 3860 images.
Taco-waste are annotated in YOLO v3 Darknet format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise, upside-down
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
* Random shear of between -10° to +10° horizontally and -10° to +10° vertically
* Random exposure adjustment of between -10 and +10 percent
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 1.64 percent of pixels
